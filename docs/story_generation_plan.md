# Story Generation Logic Implementation Plan

## 1. Modify the StoryWizard Component
- **Action**: Update the StoryWizard component to utilize the new `StoryGenerator` and `StoryGenerationService`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate input fields for story customization (character traits, settings, themes, etc.).
  - Call the `generateStoryContent` method from the `StoryGenerationService` on submission.
  - Handle loading states and errors gracefully.

## 2. Update the StoryEditor Component
- **Action**: Ensure the StoryEditor can handle the new story structure.
- **Tasks**:
  - Modify the component to accept the new `ProcessedStory` format.
  - Implement functionality to edit existing stories with the new data model.

## 3. Refactor the StoryList Component
- **Action**: Update the StoryList to display stories based on the new data model.
- **Tasks**:
  - Ensure the list correctly reflects the metadata (e.g., reading time, character traits).
  - Add options for editing and deleting stories.

## 4. Enhance the StoryNarration Component
- **Action**: Integrate the new story generation logic for audio narration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Ensure it can handle dynamically generated story content.
  - Implement playback features for the generated stories.

## 5. Update API Routes
- **Action**: Refactor the API routes to utilize the new `StoryGenerationService`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Modify the POST handler in route.ts to call the `createStory` method from `StoryGenerationService`.
  - Ensure proper error handling and response formatting.

## 6. Testing
- **Action**: Write tests for the new components and ensure existing tests are updated.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create unit tests for `StoryGenerator` and `StoryGenerationService`.
  - Test the integration of the new components with the API.
