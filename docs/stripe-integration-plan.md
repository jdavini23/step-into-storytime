# Stripe Integration Plan for Subscription Management

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating Stripe as the payment provider for subscription management in the Step Into Storytime project. It includes rationale, pros/cons, and a phased implementation approach. This plan is intended as a reference for future development.

---

## Why Stripe?

- **Industry standard** for SaaS and subscription billing.
- Supports all required features: subscription management, billing history, invoices, payment method updates.
- Excellent documentation and React/Next.js integration examples.
- Integrates well with Supabase (see [Supabase Stripe guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/stripe)).
- Handles PCI compliance via Stripe Elements.

### Pros

- Full-featured subscription and billing platform
- Secure, PCI-compliant payment forms
- Webhooks for real-time updates
- Good developer experience and community support

### Cons

- Requires Stripe account setup and configuration
- Standard payment processing fees

---

## Alternatives Considered

- **Paddle, LemonSqueezy, etc.:**
  - Pros: Some handle tax/VAT, good for global sales
  - Cons: Less direct Supabase integration, less flexible APIs
- **Supabase Native Payments:** Not available; Supabase recommends Stripe for subscriptions.

---

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Stripe Account Setup

- Create a Stripe account (if not already done)
- Set up products and pricing plans in Stripe Dashboard

### 2. Supabase Integration

- Store Stripe customer and subscription IDs in Supabase user records
- Use Stripe webhooks to sync subscription status with Supabase
- Reference: [Supabase Stripe Subscription Starter](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments)

### 3. Frontend Changes

- Use Stripe Elements for secure card input and payment method updates
- Add UI for billing history and downloadable invoices
- Add UI for updating payment method
- Display next billing date/amount

### 4. Backend/API Changes

- Use Supabase Edge Functions or Next.js API routes to handle secure Stripe operations (if needed)
- Implement endpoints for fetching invoices, updating payment methods, etc.

### 5. Testing & Launch

- Test all flows: new subscription, plan switch, cancellation, payment failure, invoice download
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility

## Additional Ideas for the Manage Subscription Page

These features are recommended to provide a complete and user-friendly subscription management experience. Most are related to billing, but some address user experience, support, and security:

### Billing & Payment Management

- **View Billing History / Invoices:** List of past payments with downloadable invoices.
- **Update Payment Method:** Allow users to change their credit card or payment info securely.
- **Show Next Billing Date/Amount:** Clearly display when and how much the next charge will be.
- **Show Trial Status:** If on trial, show days left and what happens after.
- **Show Renewal/Cancellation Policy:** Explain what happens when canceling (e.g., access until end of period).
- **Show Proration Info:** If switching plans, explain if/when proration applies.
- **Handle Payment Failures:** Show clear message if payment is past due or card is declined, with instructions to update payment.
- **Mask Card Info:** Only show last 4 digits of card in payment method display.

### User Experience & Support

- **Success Feedback:** Toasts or banners for successful actions (plan change, payment update, etc.).
- **Loading States:** Ensure all async actions have clear loading indicators.
- **Accessibility Audit:** Ensure all controls are keyboard/screen reader accessible.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Test and optimize for mobile screens.
- **Direct Support Contact:** Button or link to contact support (email, chat, etc.).
- **Contextual Help Tooltips:** Explain plan features, billing, etc., with tooltips or info icons.

### Security & Edge Cases

- **Require Re-auth for Sensitive Actions:** (Optional) Prompt for password re-entry before canceling or changing payment.
- **Handle Subscription in Paused/Pending States:** If supported by backend, show appropriate UI for these states.

## Next Steps

- Confirm Stripe as the payment provider
- Complete Stripe account and product setup
- Begin phased implementation as outlined above

**This plan can be revisited and expanded as needed.**
