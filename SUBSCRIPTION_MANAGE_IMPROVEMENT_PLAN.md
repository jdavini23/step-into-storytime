# Subscription Management Page Improvement Plan

This document outlines actionable recommendations to improve the `/subscription/manage` implementation, focusing on code quality, maintainability, performance, security, and developer experience. No changes to approved UI/UX design are proposed unless explicitly stated.

---

## 1. Code Organization & Maintainability
- [x] **Extract Business Logic:** Move complex logic (plan switching, cancellation, API calls) from the page into custom hooks or utility files.
- [x] **Component Decomposition:** Break out repeated or complex UI sections (plan cards, status banners, dialogs, feature list, boundaries) into typed, reusable components under `/subscription/components/`.
- [x] **Centralize Constants:** Place all plan/status strings, error messages, and action labels in a single constants or i18n file.

## 2. TypeScript & State Management
- [x] **Strict Typing:** Ensure all state, props, and context values are strictly typed. Use discriminated unions for subscription statuses.
- [x] **Reduce Derived State:** Derive display state (e.g., `currentProduct`, `currentPrice`, `currentTier`) from context or selector functions rather than duplicating in local state.
- [x] **Loading/Error Boundaries:** Add a boundary component to handle loading and error states in one place.

## 3. Performance & UX
- [x] **Optimistic UI:** For actions (plan change), optimistically update UI before awaiting server confirmation, then handle rollback on error.
- [ ] **Optimistic UI (Cancellation):** Pending implementation for cancellation.
- [ ] **Memoization:** Memoize expensive computations and use `React.memo` for static subcomponents to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit:** Confirm all dialogs, buttons, and alerts have correct ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.

## 4. API & Error Handling
- [x] **User-Friendly Errors:** Map backend errors to clear, actionable messages for the user.
- [x] **Retry Logic (Plan Switch):** Add retry logic or a "Retry" button for plan switching failures.
- [ ] **Retry Logic (Fetch):** Add retry logic or a "Retry" button for subscription fetching failures.
- [x] **API Abstraction:** Centralize API calls in `/lib/api/subscription.ts` for consistency and easier future changes.

## 5. Testing & Future-Proofing
- [x] **Unit Tests (Components):** Add tests for PlanCard, FeatureList, StatusBanner, ConfirmationDialog to verify rendering, accessibility, and interaction.
- [x] **Unit Tests (Hooks):** Add tests for usePlanSwitching and useCancelSubscription to verify optimistic UI, error handling, and retry logic.
- [ ] **E2E Tests:** Use Playwright or Cypress to cover critical flows (subscribe, upgrade/downgrade, cancel, error states).
- [ ] **Data-Driven Plans:** Ensure the UI and logic are fully data-driven from `PRICING_PLANS` to support future tiers.

## Progress Notes
- All core logic and UI are now modular, strictly typed, and maintainable.
- Optimistic UI and retry logic are complete for plan switching; cancellation is next.
- API calls and error handling are fully abstracted and user-friendly.
- Memoization, accessibility audit, and comprehensive testing are recommended next steps.

---

## Progress Notes (Testing)
- Unit test scaffolding is in progress, starting with PlanCard and custom hooks.
- Tests will verify optimistic UI, error states, accessibility props, and core interactions.
- E2E test coverage is recommended after unit tests for critical subscription flows.
